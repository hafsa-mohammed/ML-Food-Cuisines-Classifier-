# ML-Food-Cuisines-Classifier

Project Title:
ML Food Classifier 

Description:
This GitHub repository hosts a machine learning project for classifying food images. The project consists of two components:

1. Basic Component:

Utilizing the MLEnd Yummy Dataset.
A machine learning pipeline that predicts whether a food photo contains rice or chips.
Jupyter notebook: Basic_Component_Food_Classification.ipynb
2. Advanced Component:

Formulating a custom machine learning problem using the MLEnd Yummy Dataset.
Designing a unique machine learning solution to tackle the advanced problem.
Jupyter notebook: Advanced_Component_Custom_Cuisine_Classification.ipynb

Advanced Component Problem Formulation:
The advanced machine learning problem addressed in this project focuses on the classification of cuisine types based on food images. The challenge lies in creating a model that can accurately identify and categorize various cuisines, opening doors to applications in recipe recommendation, culinary exploration, and cultural understanding through visual content.

Instructions:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Explore the "Basic Component" notebook to understand the food classification pipeline for rice and chips.
Dive into the "Advanced Component" notebook to discover a custom machine learning problem and solution tailored to cuisine classification.
